# <a id="top">Setting up your environment</a>

Before you get started you will need to have an account with Heroku, the Heroku toolbelt and a working SSH connection to Heroku:

## Create an Heroku Account (if you dont already have one)
  1. In your browser navigate to: [https://heroku.com/signup](https://heroku.com/signup)
  2. Enter your email address
  3. Select `Sign Up`
  4. Check your email and navigate to the verification page
  5. On the command line, run `heroku login` to connect to Heroku and upload your public key.  If you do not have a public key then one will be created for you.

## Check network (SSH) access to heroku.com
  1. For Linux or MacOSX, either use an SSH client or `telnet` to verify the network connectin by running one of the following in a command prompt / terminal.  On Microsoft Windows you can use a tool called [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html):

            ssh -T heroku.com 22

  2. If the connection is refused then you will need to ask your network administrators to open up SSH access to `heroku.com` (port 22).


## Java SE 6 or greater:

  1. As you are developing a Java application, you need the Java Development Kit (JDC) which has the command for the Java compiler `javac`.  Check you have java and javac installed using the following commands:

    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0_37"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_37-b06-434-10M3909)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.12-b01-434, mixed mode)

    $ javac -version
    javac 1.6.0_27


  If you do not have javac then you need to download the Java Standard Edition JDK from Oracle:

## Download & install Play framework version 2:

     [Download Play 2 framework](http://www.playframework.com/download)

Download the latest 2.0 RC version and extract the archive to a location where you have both read and write access.  For example, create a ~/apps/play folder and extract the archive there.

*(Play updates files within its own folder, so don’t install to /opt, /usr/local or anywhere else you’d need special permission to write to.)*

## Configure Play

  1. Add the folder you extracted Play framework into onto the system PATH.

  **Linux and MacOSX:**

  Add the following text to the file `~/.profile`

    `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play20`

  Load this updated PATH into your command line using `source ~/.profile` or open a new terminal window.

  **Microsoft Windows**
  
  Windows uses a global environment variable. Update the PATH in the environment variables to add the path to the Play framework folder, ensure you don’t use a path with spaces. Open a new terminal to make sure the path has been updated.

  2. On Linux & MacOSX, make sure that the play script is executable, otherwise do a `chmod a+x play`

  3. Test play is working by running `play help` on the command line

<a href="images/00x01-play-help-first-run-output.png"><img src="images/00x01-play-help-first-run-output.png" align="middle" width="640"></a>

  When you first run play it may download extra libraries that it needs to run, so you may need to be connected to the Iternet.
  
  Assuming everything went okay, you are ready to create your first Play application.
